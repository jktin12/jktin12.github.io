title: Start With Why
---

This is my favourite TED talk ever.  I first came across it a few years ago, and it has profoundly changed the way that I communicate ideas.  Simon Sinek masterfully articulates what separates innovators and leaders like Apple and the Wright brothers from the rest of the pack.  I could go on, but you may as well just hit play.  It'll be the best 18 minutes you spend today.

Simon Sinek also wrote a book about this idea, called <a href="https://www.startwithwhy.com" target="_blank">Start With Why</a>.
