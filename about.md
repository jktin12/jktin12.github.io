It's pretty satisfying to watch someone enjoying an application that I've created.  That feeling drives me, and once I get started on a project I'm passionate about, it's hard to get me away from the keyboard.

I'm going into my 4th year of Software Engineering at Carleton University, but I prefer learning outside the classroom.

### More Information

I'm a member of Carleton <a href="http://staylateandmake.ca/" target="_blank">Stay Late and Make (SLAM)</a>, a student group offering a workspace, hardware library, and workshops for students who want to learn more than what's in their curriculum.

Apart from development, I like playing hockey and observing the stock market.  I recently got into Meetups and HackerRank.
